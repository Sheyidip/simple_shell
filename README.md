Project Description
The "Simple Shell" project is a command-line interface (CLI) program implemented in the C programming language. The goal of this project is to create a basic shell that allows users to execute system calls and interact with the operating system using a simple command-line interface. While this shell is not intended for production use, it serves as an educational exercise to understand the fundamental concepts of how a shell works.

Features
Command Execution: The shell allows users to enter and execute system commands.
Basic Error Handling: It provides basic error handling, such as command not found.
Interactive Interface: Users can interact with the shell by entering commands one at a time.
Process Management: The shell creates child processes to execute commands.
Basic Prompt: It displays a simple prompt to indicate that it's ready to accept commands.
